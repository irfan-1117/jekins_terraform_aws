üåê Automated AWS Infrastructure Deployment Project

This project showcases the automation of AWS infrastructure provisioning using Terraform and Jenkins Pipeline. With Terraform, we define the infrastructure as code (IaC), including VPC, subnets, instances, and security groups. Jenkins Pipeline automates the deployment process, ensuring consistency and efficiency.

Key Features:

Infrastructure as Code: Define AWS infrastructure using Terraform scripts.
Continuous Deployment: Jenkins Pipeline automates Terraform actions like initialization, planning, applying changes, and destruction.
Environment Configuration: Utilize environment variables for AWS credentials, default region, and Terraform backend settings.
Clean Workspace: Maintain a clean workspace by clearing it before each deployment.
Workflow:

Checkout: Fetch source code from the Git repository.
Terraform Init: Initialize Terraform with backend configuration.
Terraform Action: Execute Terraform actions specified by the user (e.g., plan, apply, destroy).
Benefits:

Efficiency: Streamline infrastructure deployment with automation.
Consistency: Ensure uniformity across environments with infrastructure as code.
Scalability: Easily scale infrastructure up or down as needed.
Reliability: Reduce manual errors and enhance deployment reliability.
This project empowers teams to swiftly deploy and manage AWS infrastructure, accelerating development and improving operational efficiency.
